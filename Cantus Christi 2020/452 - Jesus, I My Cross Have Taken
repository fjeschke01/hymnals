verse      Let     the    world   de   - spise   and    leave   me,     They     have   left    my    Sav    - ior   too;      Hu       - man    hearts   and   looks     de  - ceive   me;     Thou     art     not,    like    man,    un    - true;    And,    while   Thou    shalt   smile    up   - on     me,     God     of      wis     - dom,     love,    and    might,   Foes   may      hate,    and   friends   may   shun    me;     Show    Thy    face,     and        all      is     bright.   
verse      Man     may    trou  - ble    and     dis  - tress   me,     ’Twill   but    drive   me    to       Thy   breast;   Life       with   tri    - als   hard      may   press   me,     Heav’n   will    bring   me      sweet - er      rest.    Oh,     ’tis    not     in      grief    to     harm   me,     While   Thy     love      is       left     to     me;      Oh,    ’twere   not      in    joy       to    charm   me,     Were    that   joy       un       - mixed    with   Thee.     
verse      Take,   my     soul,   thy    full    sal  - va    - tion,   Rise     o’er   sin     and   fear     and   care;     Joy        to     find     in    ev      - ’ry   sta   - tion    Some   - thing   still   to      do      or      bear;    Think   what    Spir  - it      dwells   with - in     thee,   What    a       Fa      - ther’s   smile    is     thine,   What   a        Sav    - ior   died      to    win     thee:   Child   of     Heav’n,   shouldst   thou     re     pine?     
verse      Haste   thee   on      from   grace   to     glo   - ry,     Armed    by     faith   and   winged   by    pray’r;   Heav’n’s   e    - ter    - nal   day’s     be  - fore    thee,   God’s    own     hand    shall   guide   thee    there.   Soon    shall   close   thine   earth  - ly     mis  - sion,   Swift   shall   pass      thy      pil    - grim   days,    Hope   shall    change   to    glad      fru - i     - tion,   Faith   to     sight,    and        pray’r   to     praise.
