verse      He       who     would   val  - iant   be      ’Gainst   all    dis - as   - ter,   Let   him    in     con    - stan - cy       Fol   - low        the   Mas  - ter.   There’s   no     dis   - cour - age - ment     Shall    make   him    once   re   - lent     His    first   a    - vowed   in  - tent    To   be   a   pil - grim.   
verse      Who      so      be    - set    him    round   With      dis  - mal   sto  - ries   Do    but    them - selves   con  - found—   His     strength   the   more   is.    No        foes   shall   stay   his   might;   Though   he     with   gi   - ants   fight,   He     will    make   good    his   right   To   be   a   pil - grim.   
verse      Since,   Lord,   Thou    dost   de   - fend    Us        with   Thy   Spir - it,    We    know   we     at       the    end      Shall   life       in  - her  - it.    Then      fan  - cies    flee   a   - way!     I’ll     fear   not    what   men    say,     I’ll   la    - bor    night   and   day     To   be   a   pil - grim.
