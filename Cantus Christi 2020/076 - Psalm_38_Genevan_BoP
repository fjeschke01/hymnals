verse      LORD,   re   - buke      me    not        in     an     - ger,    And        no    long - er       Let   Thy   wrath   on    me     de    - scend.   Thou   hast   pierced   me   with      Thine   ar    - rows,   Brought   me   sor   - rows,   Bowed   me    down   with   Thine    own    hand.   Those   who    lie     in   wait   to     snare   me     Will     not    spare   me     All     the   mis   - chief   they      de  - vise.      Seem   - ing   deaf    and    dumb   be    - fore   them,   I      ig   - nore   them    And     I     of     - fer    no     re - plies.   
verse      Thou    hast   of        all   strength   be   - reft     me;     Health     has   left   me,      And   Thy   wrath   is    my     de    - spair;   My     in   - iq      - ui - ties      dis   - tress   me      And       op - press   me;     They    are   more   than   I        can    bear.   Thou,   O      LORD    my   God,   wilt   hear    me     And      be     near    me;    Thou,   O     LORD,   wilt    heed      my    voice.     Though   my    foot    may    slip   and     wa   - ver,    Show   Thy    fa   - vor     And     let   not      my     foes   re - joice.   
verse      All     my     wounds    are   foul       and    reek   - ing;    Ev       - er    weak - ’ning,   I     am    ut    - ter - ly     bowed   down.    Bit  - ter    fruits    of   fol     - ly      reap  - ing,    I         go   weep  - ing,    For     my    vig  - or     is       all    gone.   I       am     prone   to   fall   or     stum  - ble,   And      I      trem  - ble,   Think - ing   of      my      grief     and   pain.      I        ac  - knowl - edge   my     trans - gres - sion    In     con  - fes  - sion,   Deep  - ly    trou   - bled   by     my   sin.     
verse      I       am     crushed   and   numb       with   an     - guish   As         I     lan  - guish,   And   I     groan   in    mis  - er    - y.       Thou   dost   hear      my   mourn   - ful     cry   - ing,    And       my   sigh  - ing     Is      not   hid  - den,   LORD,    from   Thee.   Count - less   might - y    foes   be   - rate    me,    Fierce - ly     hate    me;    With  - out   cause   I       am        op  - pressed.   Ill      for   good    they   al   - ways    ren  - der;    Me     they   slan - der     Since   I     strive   for    what   is   best.    
verse      How     my     pound   - ing   heart      is     strain - ing;    Strength   is    wan  - ing,     And   my    eyes    are   fail - ing     me.      I      am     by        my   friends   neg   - lec   - ted     And       re - jec   - ted;    Kins  - men   see    my     plague   and    flee.   LORD,   for  - sake    me   not    but    hear    me;    Be       Thou   near    me     As      my    help    and     shield,   I     pray.      Has    - ten   to      my     aid,   O       Sav  - ior;    Show   Thy    fav  - or.     O       my    God,     do     not    de - lay.
