verse      Out    of     the   depths   of    sad  - ness,   O      LORD,      I      cried   to     Thee;      Thou    who     canst   fill   with    glad - ness,    Lend    now    Thine   ear      to    me.     O     Fount   of      con  - so  - la    - tion,   At   - tend   un - to      my   cry;   Hear   Thou    my      sup   - pli  - ca   - tion   And    to     my    help     draw   nigh.   
verse      If,    show - ing   no       com - pas  - sion,   Thou   shouldst   our    sins    re   - cord       And     mark    all     our    trans - gres - sions,   Who     then   could   stand,   O     LORD?   But   Thou    dost    par  - don   ful   - ly      All    our    in - iq    - ui - ty,    That   we      may     serve   Thee   tru  - ly     And    fear   Thy   ma     - jes  - ty.     
verse      I      wait   for   God      to    hide   me;     My     soul,      with   long  - ing    stirred,   Shall   hope,   what  - e’er   be    - tide   me,      In      His    un    - fail   - ing   word.   For   Thee,   LORD,   I      am    yearn - ing     With   more   in - tense   de - sire   Than   watch - ers     for     the    morn - ing    To     dawn   of    day      as   - pire.   
verse      Hope   in     the   LORD,    O     na   - tion!   With   Him        is     stead - fast   love;      His     plen  - te    - ous    sal   - va   - tion     He’ll   send   you     from     a   - bove.   He    will    re    - deem   His   peo   - ple,    His    chos - en   Is    - ra - el,    From   all     their   sin     and    e    - vil,   That   they   His   praise   may    tell.
