verse      The    might  - y        God    who   reigns    on     high,     In     - hab  - i     - ting   e   - ter     - ni   - ty;     Who   makes   the   Heav’n   of     heav’ns   His    throne,   The   ho    - ly,    high    and     loft  - y    One,    Be   - fore   the   splen  - dor     of     whose   rays    The    bright  - est    an     - gel    veils   His   face,    While   all    the    host,   with   one    ac - cord     Cry   “Ho  - ly,   ho   - ly,   ho    - ly    Lord!”   
verse      This   God,     though   hum  - ble   is        His    love,     Stoops   to     be    - hold   the   thing     a    - bove.   But   low   - er    still    that   love      can    go,       And   stoop   to     vis   - it      worms   be - low.    His    roy  - al    state    a     - side   He      laid,   Came   down      to     earth,   a      Man     was   made,    To      make   poor   men     the    sons   of   God,     And   pay    the   debt   His   breth - ren   owed.    
verse      With   sin    - ners     —con - de  - scen    - sion   great!—   With     sin  - ners    Je   - sus   deigned   to     eat;    And   tempt - ed    in       the    de      - sert   vast,     For   sin   - ners   He      vouch - safed   to   fast.   Hun    ger    and   thirst   with    will - ing     mind    He     un      - der  - went,    nor    once    re  - pined,   Con     tent   be   - neath   our    load   to   groan,   And   make   our   woes   and   wants   His   own.     
verse      Now,   Christ - ian,     of   - fer   pray’rs   and    praise!   Ac     - know - ledge   Him    in    all       your   ways!   Nor   alms    nor   fast   - ing    dis     - es   - teem;     For   God     ac   - cepts   them    all     in   Him.    Fear   not;   thy   gra    - cious   God    in      love    Your   pray’rs   will   hear,    your   fasts   ap  - prove.   For     what   good   thing   can    He     de - ny,      Who   gave   His   on   - ly    Son     to    die?
