verse      Once   in     the   blest   bap - tis   - mal    wa   - ters   I     put   on      Christ   and    made      Him   mine;   Now   num    bered   with   God’s   sons    and   daugh   ters,   I     share     His   peace   and   love    di - vine.    O   God,   for   Je - sus’   sake,   I   pray   Your   peace   may   bless   my   dy - ing   day.   
verse      His    bod  - y     and     His   blood   I’ve   tak  - en     In    His   blest   Sup    - per,   feast     di  - vine;   Now   I      shall   nev  - er      be      for - sak   - en,     For   I         am    His     and   He      is   mine.    O   God,   for   Je - sus’   sake,   I   pray   Your   peace   may   bless   my   dy - ing   day.   
verse      And    thus   I     live    in    God     con  - tent - ed     And   die   with  - out      a      thought   of    fear;   My    soul   has     to     God’s   plans   con - sent  - ed,     For   through   His   Son     my    faith   is   clear.
