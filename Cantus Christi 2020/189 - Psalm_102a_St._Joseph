verse      When   I      cry   to     You,     O     LORD,   hear   me     pray.    Do     not     hide   Your   face,    Lord,   in    trou - ble’s   dark   day,     But      bend     down   You    ear      to       hear     my    dis - tress     And   an    - swer   me     quick  - ly     with   swift    faith - ful - ness.    
verse      My     days   are   like   smoke,   my    bones   are    like   ash      My     heart   has    been   strick - en      and   with - ered    like   grass.   My       tongue   can  - not    taste,   my       voice    on  - ly    groans,   My    flesh   all    is     wast   - ed     and    clings   to      my    bones.   
verse      The    pel  - i   - can    moans,   the   de    - sert   owl    roams,   The    bird    on     the    roof     is      a   - wake   and     a    - lone.    Like     them,    I      must   bear     my       griefs   and   my    woes      And   bit   - ter    re   - proach   all    day    long     from    my    foes.    
verse      My     wine   is    my     tears.   My    bread   is     mere   ash.     Here   un    - der    Your   just     in    - dig - na   - tion    and    wrath,   You’ve   cast     me     a    - side,    You’ve   thrown   me    a   - way.      I     with  - er     like   grass,   like   a      flow   - er      I     fade.
