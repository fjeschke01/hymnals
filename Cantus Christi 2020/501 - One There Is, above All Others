verse      One     there   is,     a    - bove       all   oth  - ers,   Well      de  - serves   the     name     of     Friend;   His   is     love   be    - yond     a     broth - er’s,   Cost  - ly,   free,    and   knows   no    end:    They     who    once    His    kind  - ness   prove      Find   it     ev     - er    - last   - ing   love.    
verse      Which   of      all     our    friends,   to    save   us,    Could     or    would    have    shed     his    blood?    But   our    Je   - sus     died     to    have    us      Rec   - on  - ciled    in    Him     to    God.    This     was    bound - less   love    in   - deed;      Je   - sus    is       a       Friend   in    need.    
verse      When    He      lived   on     earth      a   - bas  - ed,    “Friend   of    sin    - ners”   was      His    name,     Now   a    - bove   all     glo    - ry    rais  - ed,     He      re  - joic   - es    in      the   same;   Still    He     calls   them   breth - ren,   friends,   And    to     all      their   wants    at  - tends.   
verse      Could   we      bear    from   one        an  - oth  - er     What      He    dai    - ly      bears    from   us?       Yet   this   glo  - rious   Friend   and   Broth - er      Loves   us    though   we    treat   Him   thus:   Though   for    good    we     ren   - der    ill,       He     ac   - counts   us      breth  - ren   still.   
verse      Oh,     for     grace   our    hearts     to    soft - en!    Teach     us,   Lord,    at      length   to     love;     We,   a    - las!   for   - get      too   oft   - en      What    a     Friend   we    have    a   - bove.   But      when   home    our    souls   are    brought,   We     will   love     Thee    as       we    ought.
