verse      He       who    in     e     - vil   does    re   - joice   Hears   in   his   heart   a     wick  - ed     voice;   It    whis  - pers   and    it    flat  - ters.   It     lures   him    on,    and   he      o    - beys    Till   from   Thy    fear,   O       LORD,   he      strays   And   him   Thine   an      - ger    shat   - ters.   His    words   are     lies,   his   wis  - dom    gone;   All   his   trans - gres  - sions   urge   him   on,     He    does   their   will   with    pleas - ure.   Up   - on      his    bed      he     plans    de  - ceit,   On     ways    of     sin       he   sets   his   feet,    His   e   - vil     is     his    treas - ure.   
verse      Thy      love   and    faith - ful - ness    ex   - tend    Wher  - ev - er    Thou    to    heav  - en’s   end      Thy   right - eous   scep - ter   wield - est.    Thy    judg  - ment   is     a     se    - cret   deep,   Thy    jus  - tice   like    God’s   moun  - tains   steep,   And   man   and     beast     Thou   shield - est.    Of     Thy     great   mer   - cy    heav - en     sings   For   in    the     shad  - ow      of     Thy   wings   No    son    of      man    shall   per   - ish.   Thou   shalt   them   to       Thy    feasts   in  - vite,   They   drink   from   streams   of   Thy    de  - light,   Thy   pre - cious   love   they   cher  - ish.   
verse      Life’s   foun - tain   is,     O     LORD,   with   Thee,   And     in   Thy   light   the   light   we     see;     Let   right   and    mer  - cy    tar   - ry      With   them    who    fear   Thy   faith - ful    name;   Put    Thou   the    en    - e     - mies    to      shame,   Let   all   their   schemes   mis  - car    - ry.     Save   Thou    me      for     Thy   mer  - cy’s   sake,   Let   not   the     proud   me      o    - ver - take,   Nor   from   Thy     cov  - ’nant   sev   - er.    O      peo   - ple,   praise   your   God      and   see     The    work  - ers    of        in - iq   - ui  - ty       Who   are   cast    down   for  - ev    - er!
