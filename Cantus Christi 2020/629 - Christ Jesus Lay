verse      Christ   Je  - sus    lay       in     death’s   strong   bands,   For     our       of  - fens  - es    giv   - en;   But      now    at    God’s   right   hand     He     stands   And   brings   us     life     from   Heav   - en.   There  - fore,   let     us     joy   - ful    be      And     sing     to    God    right   thank - ful - ly       Loud    songs   of    hal  - le  - lu   - jah.   Hal - le - lu - jah!   
verse      It       was   a      strange   and    dread   - ful      strife   When    life      and   death   con - tend  - ed.   The      vic  - to  - ry      re    - mained   with   life;    The   reign    of     death    was    end    - ed.   Ho     - ly      Scrip - ture   plain - ly     saith   That    death    is    swal - lowed   up      by    death;   His     sting   is    lost   for - ev   - er.    Hal - le - lu - jah!   
verse      Here     the   true   Pas     - chal   Lamb      we       see,     Whom    God       so    free  - ly    gave    us.   He       died   on    the     ac    - curs   - ed     tree—    So    strong   His    love!—   to     save     us.   See,     His     blood   doth   mark    our    door;   Faith   points   to    it,    death   pass  - es    o’er,    And     Sa    - tan   can  - not   harm   us.    Hal - le - lu - jah!   
verse      So       let   us     keep      the    fes     - ti     - val      Where - to        the   Lord    in  - vites   us;   Christ   is     Him - self    the     joy      of     all,     The   sun      that   warms    and    lights   us.   By       His     grace   He     doth    im   - part    E     - ter    - nal   sun  - shine   to      the   heart;   The     night   of    sin    is    end  - ed.    Hal - le - lu - jah!   
verse      Then     let   us     feast     this   joy     - ful      day      On      Christ,   the   bread   of    Heav  - en;   The      word   of    grace   hath    purged   a    - way      The   old      and    e      - vil    leav   - en.   Christ   a     - lone    our    souls   will   feed;   He      is       our   meat   and     drink   in  - deed.    Faith   lives   up  - on     no    oth  - er.    Hal - le - lu - jah!
