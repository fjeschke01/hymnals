verse      	How firm a foun - da - tion, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your

verse       faith in His ex - cel - lent word!  What more can He say than to

verse       you He hath said, To you who for ref - uge to Je - sus have fled?

verse       "Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dis - mayed, For I am thy

verse       God, and will still give thee aid; I’ll strength - en thee, help thee, and

verse       cause thee to stand, Up - held by My grac - ious, om - nip - o - tent hand."

verse       "When through the deep wa - ters I call thee to go, The riv - ers of

verse       woe shall not thee o - ver - flow; For I will be with thee, thy

verse       trou - bles to bless, And sanc - ti - fy to thee thy deep - est dis - tress."

verse       "When through fi - ery tri - als thy path - way shall lie, My grace, all suf -

verse       fi - cient, shall be thy sup - ply; The flame shall not hurt thee; I

verse       on - ly de - sign Thy dross to con - sume, and thy gold to re - fine."

verse       "The soul that on Je - sus hath leaned for re - pose, I will not, I

verse       will not desert to His foes; That soul, though all hell should en -

verse       deav - or to shake, I’ll nev - er, no, nev - er, no, nev - er for - sake!"
